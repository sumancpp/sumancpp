## ðŸ’«About Me:

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a BTech CSE student, currently working on building responsive web applications and sharpening my C++ skills. Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ to level up my problem-solving game, looking to collaborate on open-source web development or DSA projects, also looking for help with optimizing algorithms and advanced C++ techniques. Ask me about web development, JavaScript, or basic DSA concepts!
